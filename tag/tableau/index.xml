      <title>A life of war (MakeoverMonday Week 6)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s MakeoverMonday&lt;/a&gt; is a good one.  Without further ado, the original visualization by Philip Bump, appearing in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/08/nearly-quarter-americans-have-never-experienced-us-time-peace/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Washington Post article&lt;/a&gt; entitled &lt;em&gt;Nearly 
a quarter of Americans have never experienced the U.S. in a time of peace&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt; 
&lt;img src=&#34;https://driftlessdata.space/img/mm6-original.png&#34; alt=&#34;placeholder&#34; title=&#34;original graph&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph triggered my pedagogical Pavlovian dog.  Not just because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to malign the poor pie chart (of which this graph has 115!), but because I had a hunch that a 
redesign would reveal features of the data that are obscured above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, since we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have pie charts, why not briefly discuss their relative merits and demerits.  Pie charts are fine if we want to show portions of a whole, and then 
only if we have relatively few slices.  In each pie above, we have only two slices for most years. So a pie chart would be just fine if, for example, I only cared about 
showing the relative portion of life lived in war and peace for people born in 1905.  The problem is that we don&amp;rsquo;t just have a pie for 1905, but for every year 1905-2019.  If we 
wanted to see how the percents change over time, we have to compare slice sizes &lt;em&gt;across pies&lt;/em&gt;, and this is very hard to do perceptually.  This draws from the work of William Cleveland, who ranked the elementary perceptual tasks we use to 
compare quantities.  We are very bad at making accurate comparisons when the quantities are encoded as angles (I discuss this in more detail &lt;a href=&#34;http://driftlessdata.space/post/on-epts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Washington Post graph, the thing that jumps out at me is the column of all-red on the right, and how much less red there is on the left.  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that people born since 2001 have lived their entire life 
during a U.S. war; those born in the early 20th century lived a much smaller portion of their lives during war.  What is &lt;em&gt;much less&lt;/em&gt; obvious is the nature of the upward trend: was it monotone?  Up-and-down? 
This is hard to tell!  It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that in the original article, with my desktop Chrome browser at normal zoom, the graph is so tall that you have to scroll up and down to take it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my redesign (&lt;a href=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/WhatportionofyourlifehastheU_S_beenatwarMakeoverMondayW6/Dashboard1?:display_count=y&amp;amp;publish=yes&amp;amp;:origin=viz_share_link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tableau Public link&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://driftlessdata.space/img/US_at_war.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think of area charts as pie charts that work over time.  The redesign still shows us what the original did: people born in the early 20th century lived a much smaller portion of their lives
during war than people born in 2001.  We have preserved the &amp;ldquo;part-of-a-whole&amp;rdquo; story that pie charts have to tell. What the redesign reveals is that the upward trend is not monotone.  Rather we see a &amp;ldquo;sawtooth&amp;rdquo; pattern, where the saw teeth peak during wars
and and dip following wars.  Now that we have mapped these percents to a common vertical axis instead of encoded them as angles in a pie chart, we can perceive differences between them much more clearly.   And as a bonus, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to do any scrolling!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick caveat: my redesign only includes the same wars listed in the original article, but you could argue the U.S. has been involved in many wars beyond just the ones shown.  Take a look for example at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this list from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MakeoverMonday: Pesticide usage in US</title>
      <link>https://driftlessdata.space/post/makeovermondayweek2-pesticides/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <guid>https://driftlessdata.space/post/makeovermondayweek2-pesticides/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted!  For a while I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in joining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MakeoverMonday&lt;/a&gt; community, a group
of data visualizers who come together each week to critique and redesign a visualization provided by Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel.  I haven&amp;rsquo;t, due to busyness mostly, but this semester I finally took the 
dive and signed up!  Call it a 2020 resolution. I hope that this will become a regular opportunity for me to keep developing my visualization critique and design skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed my first challenge, &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MakeoverMonday 2020 Week 2&lt;/a&gt;,  a simple visualization that nonetheless provides a lot to think about and was a challenging redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the original visualization, Figure 1 from the &lt;em&gt;Environmental Health&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a href=&#34;https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-019-0488-0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USA lags behind other agricultural nations in banning harmful pesticides&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://driftlessdata.space/img/mm2-original.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w2/workspace/file?filename=MM&amp;#43;data&amp;#43;week&amp;#43;2&amp;#43;2020.xlsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data provided at data.world&lt;/a&gt; for the redesign don&amp;rsquo;t actually contain the same information on counts that we see in the original viz, but rather
data on total weight of pesticides that are banned/phased out in other countries that were applied used in the U.S. in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My critiques of the original figure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way the &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; is divvied up (whether that &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; is number of pesticides or total lbs applied) between EU, Brazil, and China is very unclear.  The figure tries to get at intersections by
including $\geq 1$, $\geq 2$ and All 3, but it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to know which pesticides are banned by (for example) both China and Brazil.  It takes a while to understand what the &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The categories along the horizontal are a mix of both country labels and &lt;em&gt;number of countries&lt;/em&gt;.  I don&amp;rsquo;t like this mixing of label types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only counts of pesticides are shown: no information about &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of pesticides applied is available in the visualization shown.  For example, China has banned only 11 pesticides, but does it ban the &amp;ldquo;big ones&amp;rdquo; as applied in the U.S.?  We can&amp;rsquo;t 
tell from the figure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my redesign, I had a couple goals to address these critiques:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make clear what the &amp;ldquo;whole&amp;rdquo; is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the viewer to see where the intersections in banned pesticides exist.  E.g., if a pesticide is banned in the EU, is it also banned in China, or in Brazil?  All 3?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization amount applied rather than counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this I had to dig a bit deeper than the data provided on Data World, and found what I was looking for with &lt;a href=&#34;https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12940-019-0488-0/MediaObjects/12940_2019_488_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Additional File 5, Tables S131-S133&lt;/a&gt; from
the article.  I also had to do a bit of cleaning.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/oop1g8ws3dbwir3/pesticide_clean.csv?dl=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link to the data&lt;/a&gt; I ultimately ended up connecting to in Tableau&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, my redesign (&lt;a href=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/pesticide_viz/Dashboard32?:display_count=y&amp;amp;publish=yes&amp;amp;:origin=viz_share_link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tableau Public version&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://driftlessdata.space/img/mm2.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some design comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This accomplishes (I think) a clear visual of &amp;ldquo;the whole&amp;rdquo;: the giant (perhaps too giant) grey box with &amp;ldquo;328 million pounds&amp;rdquo; are the first things you see&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If desired, you can see which pesticides are banned in the EU, China, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and/or&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Brazil.  This information was obscured before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now see that although China has banned fewer pesticides, they are pesticides that are more widely used (at least in the U.S.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critique of my own redesign: are the percents meaningful?  &amp;ldquo;98%&amp;rdquo; is a weird percent: the percent of &lt;em&gt;US-applied&lt;/em&gt; pesticides that are banned in the EU.  If they were banned in the US,
would they be replaced by something else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technical comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grey box is giant, perhaps too much so, but getting Tableau to label the cells of the treemap in a satisfactory way was a pain.  Some of the labels (e.g. Fomesan) I added manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the four treemaps to divide the pesticides up in the same way, while applying different color schemes, was a pain and I used a hack approach (download the Tableau workbook if you are curious).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R code for creating the .csv I used in my redesign, which begins with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/npu4pp5oaxewznz/pesticide_complete_stack.csv?dl=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;stacked version&lt;/a&gt; of Tables S131-S133 from 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs12940-019-0488-0/MediaObjects/12940_2019_488_MOESM5_ESM.xlsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Additional file 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pest &amp;lt;- read.csv(&#39;pesticide_complete_stack.csv&#39;)

library(tidyr) 
library(dplyr)
lbs &amp;lt;- pest %&amp;gt;% group_by(Pesticide) %&amp;gt;% summarize(USLbs2016 = mean(USLbs2016))
use &amp;lt;- function(col) ifelse(is.na(col),0,1)

out &amp;lt;- pest %&amp;gt;% spread(key = CountryBanned, value = USLbs2016) %&amp;gt;%
  inner_join(lbs, by = &#39;Pesticide&#39;) %&amp;gt;%

  mutate(nbanned = Brazil + China + EU) %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(used_US = ifelse(USLbs2016&amp;gt; 0, 1, 0)) %&amp;gt;% 
  select(Pesticide, USLbs2016, EU,China,Brazil,nbanned,used_US)

      <title>Quantifying thrill</title>
      <link>https://driftlessdata.space/post/viz-worldseries-wpa/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://driftlessdata.space/post/viz-worldseries-wpa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monday morning, October 30, found me groggy and sandy-eyed.  The culprit was the 5-hour and 17-minute, 10-inning thriller between the LA Dodgers and Houston Astros in Game 5 of the 2017 the night before.  Thanks to living in the Central Time Zone, I went to bed around 1am. The Astros ended up defeating the Dodgers 13-12, but the game was insane, featuring three comebacks from deficits of 3 runs or more.  By the end, I was emotionally exhausted, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a stake in either team!  Lots was written about the game over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fangraphs.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fangraphs&lt;/a&gt;, one of my favorite baseball analytics websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/game-five-was-as-weird-as-it-felt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;post in particular&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Edwards caught my attention from a data visualization perspective.  It compared the game to another epic game: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN201110270.shtml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Game 6 of the 2011 World Series&lt;/a&gt;, where the St. Louis Cardinals staved off elimination by defeating the Texas Rangers 10-9 in 11 innings.  The crux of the article was a table that listed the top-20 &amp;ldquo;most exciting events&amp;rdquo; of each World Series side-by-side.  Here is a screenshot of said table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;figure&gt; 
&lt;img src=&#34;https://driftlessdata.space/img/wpa-table.JPG&#34; width=&#34;400&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &amp;ldquo;exciting event&amp;rdquo; is one that yields a large swing in the win expectancy of the game, as measured by Win Probability Added, or WPA.  Read Fangraph&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/library/misc/wpa/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;excellent glossary entry on WPA&lt;/a&gt; for more detail, but essentially, the bigger the WPA of an event, the more exciting it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table is great, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see which of the two games has the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; exciting Top-20 events.  I wanted to visualize!  But I needed the data.  Fangraphs has play logs for every single Major League game, which lists (among other metrics) the events of the game; the win expectancy following the event; and the WPA of the event.  I needed data from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2011-10-27&amp;amp;team=Cardinals&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2011&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Game 6, 2011&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2017-10-29&amp;amp;team=Astros&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Game 5, 2017&lt;/a&gt; play logs.  But I needed them both in the same data source!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; has a great package &lt;code&gt;rvest&lt;/code&gt; that makes web-scraping (especially scraping html tables) quite easy.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the code I wrote to scrape the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2011-10-27&amp;amp;team=Cardinals&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2011&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Game 6, 2011&lt;/a&gt; data; do some cleaning; and write the cleaned data into a .csv file.  I wrote very similar code to get the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2017-10-29&amp;amp;team=Astros&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2017&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Game 5, 2017&lt;/a&gt; data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
#Read in the data, find the right table:
url &amp;lt;- &#39;https://www.fangraphs.com/plays.aspx?date=2011-10-27&amp;amp;team=Cardinals&amp;amp;dh=0&amp;amp;season=2011&#39;
raw &amp;lt;- read_html(url)%&amp;gt;%
       html_table(fill=TRUE)
mytable &amp;lt;- raw[[9]][,1:12]

#Use dplyr to clean it up. By code row:
  #Create absolute value of WPA
  #Create new column to indicate the game
  #Remove the &amp;quot;%&amp;quot; from the win expectancy, create Event number
  #Arrange in descending order by WPA
  #Create rank column
cleantable &amp;lt;- mytable %&amp;gt;%
  mutate(WPA_abs = abs(WPA)) %&amp;gt;%                                            
  mutate(Game = rep(&#39;Game 6, 2011&#39;,nrow(mytable))) %&amp;gt;%                    
  mutate(WE = as.numeric(gsub(&#39;%&#39;,&#39;&#39;,WE)), Event = 1:nrow(mytable)) %&amp;gt;%      
  arrange(-WPA_abs) %&amp;gt;%                                                     
  mutate(WPA_Rank = 1:nrow(mytable))                                          

#Write cleaned data to csv file
write.csv(cleantable,file=&#39;WPA_Game6_2011_all.csv&#39;,row.names=FALSE)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on to visualizing!  Using Tableau, I created a win-expectancy graph for each of the games.  The red dots indicate &amp;ldquo;exciting events&amp;rdquo;; events with WPA of 15% or more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/WPA_WS_blog/tracker-dash?:embed=y?:showVizHome=no&#34;
 width=&#34;755&#34; height=&#34;392&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, both games were crazy, with wild swings in win expectancy!  If you count up the red dots, Game 6 in 2011 had 8 &amp;ldquo;exciting events&amp;rdquo; while Game 5 in 2017 had 10 &amp;ldquo;exciting events.&amp;rdquo;  15% is quite an arbitrary threshold for &amp;ldquo;exciting&amp;rdquo; however; different thresholds would likely change the comparison.  Comparing total WPA flips the story: the total WPA of 7.2 in Game 6, 2011 was larger than the total WPA of 6.2 in Game 5, 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My primary interest, however, was to compare the top-20 most exciting events of both games in a clearer visual manner, respecting principles of human perception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://public.tableau.com/views/WPA_WS_blog/Top-20?:embed=y?:showVizHome=no&#34;
 width=&#34;655&#34; height=&#34;495&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this graph, we can see the four points on the right that lie below the reference line.  These indicate that the top four most exciting events in Game 6, 2011 were &lt;em&gt;more exciting&lt;/em&gt; than the top four most exciting events from Game 5, 2017.  On the other hand, the top 5-10 most exciting events in Game 5, 2017 lie above the reference line, indicating they were more exciting than the events with WPA ranked 5-10 in Game 6, 2011.  The rest of the events ranked 11-20 in WPA go back to lying below the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it does appear that Game 6, 2011 was truly a more thrilling game than Game 5, 2017!   The total WPA of Game 6, 2011 was greater than the total WPA in Game 5, 2017, and of the top-20 &amp;ldquo;most exciting&amp;rdquo; events, they tended to be &lt;em&gt;more exciting&lt;/em&gt; in 2011. Oh well, Game 5, 2017 was still worth losing a few hours of sleep!  I think&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
